Cmdlet Module for RandomStuff
==============================

Not much to see here for now but it will try to make some of the scripts available as Cmdlets in this module.
The Module is written in C# and the .csproj file was created for a .netstandard2.0 version but I switched to .net6 since the commands are aimed to be used with windows anyway.

The build stuff is more or less dotnet cli and I will add it as soon as possible but there are many resources on the net that tell you how to build it.
